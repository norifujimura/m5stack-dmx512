# m5stack-dmx512

Modified https://qiita.com/Ina3/items/4a596d8f0849917c5058 code using SoftwareSerial https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/softwareSerial in order to set Tx port as needed. Currently support M5Stack Core2 and Atom. My test set is either Core2 or Atom and this DMX adapter https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-DMX512/
